ASP.NET Core Web API CRUD with Angular is a web application project that provides a basic implementation of a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core on the back end and Angular on the front end. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of cards.

The back end of the application is implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API, which provides a powerful and flexible framework for building web APIs. The API exposes a set of endpoints that allow clients to perform CRUD operations on the card data stored in a database. The API uses Entity Framework Core to interact with the database and perform operations like create, read, update, and delete.

The front end of the application is built using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building single-page applications. The Angular application communicates with the back end using HTTP requests to the API endpoints. The user interface is designed using Angular Material, a UI component library that provides a set of pre-built UI components like buttons, cards, and forms.

The project includes features like data validation, error handling, and logging to ensure the application is robust and reliable. The project also includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the application is functioning correctly and any changes made to the code do not break existing functionality.

The project can be used as a starting point for building more complex web applications that require a back end API and a front end client. Users can clone the project from GitHub and run it locally or deploy it to a server for production use.

Overall, ASP.NET Core Web API CRUD with Angular is a great project for developers who want to learn how to build web applications using ASP.NET Core and Angular, as well as for those who want to build a basic web application quickly and easily.
